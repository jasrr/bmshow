# 1. Requirements for Designing the System

## 1.1 Functional Requirements
User Authentication and Management: Secure registration, login, profile management, and password recovery.
Movie Management: CRUD operations for movies, including adding, updating, and deleting movies and showtimes.
Showtime Management: Real-time tracking and scheduling of movie showtimes.
Reservation System: Users can reserve tickets in advance and manage their reservations.
Payment Processing: Integration with multiple payment gateways to handle transactions securely.
Theater Management: Manage multiple theaters and screen configurations.
User Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to review and rate movies.

## 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: The system should respond to user requests within milliseconds to ensure a smooth experience.
Data Integrity: Maintain accurate and consistent data across all system components.
Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing numbers of users, movies, and reservations without performance degradation.
Availability: Ensure high availability with minimal downtime, targeting an uptime of 99.9%.
Disaster Recovery: Implement backup and recovery procedures to handle data loss or system failures.

# 2. Capacity Estimation

To estimate capacity:

Monthly Traffic: 100,000 users
Average Transactions Per Second (TPS): 0.038 transactions per user
Reservation Assumptions: 50% reserve in advance, 25% pay without reservation
Storage Requirements:
TPS: 50 + 25 = 75
Storage Per Transaction: Approx. 300 KB (including user data and reservation details)
Total Storage Needed: 75 * 300 KB = 22.5 MB per second
Annual Storage: 22.5 MB * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 ≈ 710 TB


# 3. Use Case Diagram
A use case diagram provides a visual representation of interactions:

Registered User: Can log in, reserve tickets, view booking history, write reviews, and rate movies.
Unregistered User: Can browse movies, check showtimes, and view general information.
Admin: Can manage movies, showtimes, theaters, and view system analytics.

# 10. Principles Applied
## 10.1 SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each service should focus on a single responsibility, like user management or payment processing.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Design services to be easily extensible without modifying existing code, facilitating new feature integration.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Ensure that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base classes.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Create fine-grained interfaces specific to each service’s functionality.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations to promote flexibility and testability.

Redundancy: Use redundant systems and failover strategies to maintain service availability.
## 10.3 Scalability
Horizontal Scaling: Increase system capacity by adding more instances of services and databases.
Load Balancing: Distribute user requests across servers to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
## 10.4 Security Best Practices

Secure Authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
Authorization: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS.
## 10.5 Performance Optimization
Caching: Use caching to store frequently accessed data and reduce database queries.
Indexing: Implement database indexing to speed up query performance.
Asynchronous Processing: Use asynchronous processing to handle long-running tasks and improve system responsiveness.
## 10.6 Maintainability
Code Quality: Maintain high code quality with proper documentation and adherence to coding standards.
Automated Testing: Implement automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and system reliability.
